# The way to go

This repository intends to go through all the core concepts of `golang` using code samples and exercises. The intent is to generate a thorough understanding of the concepts and create code snippets for future use.

##### Core Concepts
- Simple and composite types
- Control structure
- functions
- structs with their methods
- interfaces
- goroutines and channels for concurrency and multicore systems
- OOP concepts w.r.t golang
- working with files in different formats
- error handling mechanisms
- networking techniques for distributed systems
- golang on cloud

The idea is to learn these concepts and use them to create a large scale application with recommended code organization approaches.
